# Accelerometer

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/python-sh3001
cd python-sh3001
sudo python3 install.py â€ƒ
```

For how to use, you can refer to the auto-rotator.md file under the docs file in the python-sh3001 root directory (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OoguOYlNk4iNunHv9ijh99rVqVEtWL_-/view?usp=sharing)

git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/python-sh3001.git

Then execute install.py installation program (reference picture: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fc_519QyE2CeSjWHWDQKm9gzaF8dlgOW/view?usp=sharing).

According to the prompt of auto-rotator.md in the docs directory, you can turn on the rotating screen, turn off the rotating screen, or calibrate (refer to the picture: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SiiyXDni3_NqCELY2GfISy-Uy5VRN8eE/view?usp=sharing).

# Touchscreen

There are two HDMI cables connected between the Raspberry Pi and the raspad motherboard in raspad3

If an additional external screen is connected the touch function cannot be used normally and it will cancel the touch function when the screen is connected to the screen.

It is judged whether the external screen is connected with the voltage of HDMI. The voltage is the initial value when the two HDMI interfaces of the Raspberry Pi are connected to the radpad3 motherboard. Using the external HDMI interface on the raspad3 motherboard, or not connecting the HDMI cable between the Raspberry Pi HDMI1 interface and raspad3, will cause the voltage to deviate from the initial value, and the motherboard will make a judgment and turn off the touch.

If you do not have an external screen and both HDMI cables are connected, it may be that the HDMI cable of the HDMI 1 port is faulty, that is, the shorter one. You can try to exchange these two hdmi lines to see if it can start successfully. Test as shown below.

If a longer HDMI cable is broken, it will also cause the voltage of the judgment state to deviate, thereby turning off the touch. You can exchange two hdmi cables for testing, refer to the attached video.
